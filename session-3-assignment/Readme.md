# Assignment Session 3

- Make a FastAPI, or Flask-based application that:
    - allows you to load a data file, and show it (1 sample)
    - then allows you to preprocess it and show how it looks now
    - then allows you to augment it and show how it looks now


Your assignment is to work on either text, image, audio file, or 3d file (.off shared in the code earlier)
