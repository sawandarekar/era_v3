Create new folder assignment-session4-v2 and under that write a simple 4 layer convolutional neural network, to be trained on fasion mnist dataset

frontend interface to allow users to compare 2 models by providing 2 sets of numbers (like 16, 32, 64, or 8, 8, 8, etc.). 
Then train both models one by one and show their results "overlapped" on the same graphs so we can analyze the differences between 2 models in terms of losses and accuracies. 

To train the dataset i want following parameters and these parameters should come from frontend UI
- Optimizer Adam or SGD
- Batch Size
- Epoch

while training i want to see the training logs, while training use tdqm, as i dont want too many logs, also i want to see the traings log and loss curve stats on frontend, create frontend using bootstrap

after training is done, show model results on randon 10 images picked from fasion mnist dataset, Use CUDE for training. Write all the files including howTo.md file describing steps
